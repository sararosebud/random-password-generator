## Random Password Generator	

## Description

An application created from starter code that when modified will enable employees who have access to sensitive data to generate a strong random password after selecting criteria prompted by the application. User will be able to:

- Click a button that will generate a password
- Pick a password length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters after being promted to do so.  
- Select which criteria to include in the password. Criteria to be included or excluded is as follows: 
  - Numbers, Special Characters, Uppercase letters, and Lowercase letters. 

If the user input does not meet the required criteria (password lenght and at least one character type) the application will prompt the user to try again with the correct and required criteria. 

Once the user answers all of the prompts the input will be validated to ensure at least one character type is selected. If not, the user will have to try again by clicking the generate password button again. 

When all input criteria is met, a password will be generated and available for user to copy from the text box on the page.
